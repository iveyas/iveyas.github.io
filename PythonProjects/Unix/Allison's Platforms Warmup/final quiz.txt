===========================================================================================

The following is my final "your feedback appreciated" quiz.  I've used suggestions from 
these quizzes to adjust course content, pacing, and accountabilities.   The more focused 
you can be, the easier I'll find it to apply your suggestions to future editions of this course.

==================

1.  What, if anything, worked well about the choice of material that was presented? 
    What could have been done better?


2.  What, if anything, worked well about the content and/or character of the assignments?  
    What could have been done better?


3.  What, if anything, worked well about the content and/or use of the lecture notes?
    What could have been done better?


4.  What, if anything, worked well about the content and/or management of the classes themselves?
    What could have been done better?


5.  If, perish forbid, you had to take this course another time, what one thing about the 
    course would you most want to see stay the same?


6.  If, perish forbid, you had to take this course another time, what one thing about the 
    course would you most want to see change, and how?
